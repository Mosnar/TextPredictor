# PredictiveKeyboard

A simple example implementation of how a predictive keyboard might work. This was written for an Asymmetrik interview
assignment. It works by populating a trie data structure with a training phrase and then querying it with partial
fragments, which would represent a word as a user is typing.


## Installation

Clone the repo - no dependencies necessary besides JDK 8.
